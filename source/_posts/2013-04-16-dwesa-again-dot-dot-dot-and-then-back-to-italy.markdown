I almost forgot about this page in the last month or so in SA, so no interesting post about my stay in South Africa...

Anyway, I'm going back to Dwesa tomorrow for a huge celebration held by the Siyakhula Living Lab there to which a lot of important people (including a king!) will participate. It looks fun except the formal dress code and the fact that it might rain.

One thing I learned here is that you never know what is gonna happen tomorrow so we'll see... One thing I know for sure (and there's a story behind that as well) is that I'll go back to Italy on the 23rd of April. So it's one week to go!
